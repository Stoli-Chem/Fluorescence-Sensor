# Fluorescence-Sensor
These files are blueprints to create an in line fluorescence detector, compatible with fluorescein and ideal for measuring RTD of reactors. Different filters can be used to create a sensor for different tracers. 
Kapton tape is used as a filter for fluorescein. The printable files only produce the housing, additional components are also required to function:
•	PVC heatshrink
•	M3 bolts 
•	Clear section of pipe 
•	Arduino NANO
•	Adafruit ALS-PT19 Analog Light Sensor Breakout
•	ADS1115 16-Bit ADC - 4 Channel with Programmable Gain Amplifier
•	Blue LED
•	68Ω Resistor 
•	Kapton tape
•	Wires
•	Breadboard
•	Arduino nano
•	Reflective tape
•	Glue gun

**Assembly:**
2 pieces of PVC heatshrink need to be placed on the clear pipe, leaving a one inch gap between them. After the hollowed out area for the pipe is lined with reflective tape, clear pipe can then be laid in the bottom half of the black box. 3 Wires should be soldered to the light sensor before they are fed through the top half of the black box, allowing the light sensor to fit in place. A piece of kapton tape should then be placed over the inwards facing part of the sensor. Reflective tape should be placed over the wires on the outside of the box. The 2 halves of the black box can then be placed together. A drill should be used first to remove any deformities from printing in the bolt holes. They then need to be tapped 3mm. After this, 4 M3 bolts can be used to hold the 2 halves of the box together. The blue LED is placed on the remaining hole on the side of the black box and can be secured with a glue gun. The box is now complete and all that remains to do is the wiring.  
An image showing the wiring configuration is included in the files.
